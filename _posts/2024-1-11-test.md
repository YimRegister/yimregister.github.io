I am wrapping up my PhD this summer, and currently applying for a wide variety of jobs! I'm not sure what the future holds for me yet, but hopefully I can represent my interests and passions and goals in this corner of the internet.

I'm currently working on a tab to put all my teaching resources. I've co-taught our Master's Machine Learning course for 4 years now, and recently received a grant to develop a series of Jupyter Notebooks that teach a variety of ML algorithms in an ethics oriented way.

I'm working on a tab to list my projects that didn't quite make it to publication -- some code snippets and ideas and projects in the works.

I also will have my art and my writing available, and some of my favorite resources so you can use them or read them like I do!. In the meantime, the bare bones of what I'm about is listed on this website. As always, I am guided by the quote:
