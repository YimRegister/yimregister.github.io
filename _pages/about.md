Let's meet at the intersection of joy and justice.

I am an [NSF GRFP Fellow](https://ischool.uw.edu/news/2019/11/phd-students-have-passion-inclusive-tech-education) and PhD candidate at the University of Washington [Information School](https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/phd). I study ways that AI algorithms can cause harm, and the best practices for identifying and remedying such algorithmic harms. My main focus is AI education -- using trauma-informed computing to teach AI in empowering, inclusive, and supportive ways. I study the full life cycle of ML algorithms -- from data collection to model selection to model evaluation and deployment; all with the goals of societal benefit and user safety and empowerment. From basic regression to large language models (LLMs), my goals are to quantify bias in the data and output, as well as identify potential harms that may come from the technology we create. 

When we create technology with compassion, we create a better world for everyone. I've worked with [RStudio](https://education.rstudio.com/), [Code.org](https://code.org/), [MD4SG](https://www.md4sg.com/), and the [Center for an Informed Public](https://www.cip.uw.edu/). I also do visiting talks and workshops, such as *[The Future of AI Can Be Kind](https://www.canva.com/design/DAF0ExseDCw/LcWBNULn85dUPQKEgEMt8Q/view?utm_content=DAF0ExseDCw&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor)* or *[Mental Health, Social Media, and Empowerment](https://www.probonocounseling.org/event/mental-health-social-media-and-empowerment-navigating-client-experiences-with-information-online/)*. I often create [educational resources](/teaching/) and guest lecture on AI/ML topics.

I am also an artist, an avid reader of poetry, a dancer, and an active member of my communities. I advocate for addiction recovery, mental health support, prison reform, and overdose awareness. I am a former child advocate for foster children, and I even used to teach kindergarten before I found my way into my PhD! I use my experiences to expand my perspectives and beliefs about what is possible. 

If we work together, &#10024;*the future of AI can be kind*&#10024;.
